# Tim Cockerill

## Web Developer based in Charlotte, North Carolina

---

> Hi, thanks for checking out my Github.  I'm currently working towards a career in web development, and my goal is to be employed as a React developer by the end of 2022.  I completed a coding boot camp at UNC-Charlotte in January 2020 that taught the fundametals of JavaScript and introduced us to the MERN stack.  I'm currently working on furthering my React knowledge through the Udemy Academind Complete React course, and also use FreeCodeCamp daily to maintain, expand, and hone my current HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge.  

>Feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/dtimcockerill2), and check out [my portfolio](www.timcwebdev.com) when you get the chance!  I'll be updating it and adding more projects soon.
